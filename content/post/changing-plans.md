I'm writing this from the quayside having just watched my crew sail away. Best
of luck guys - sorry I'm not with you.

It's a little strange being sat here - as most people know, I was planning to
go the whole way round the world on this year's Clipper race. However, between
the sailing, cooking, cleaning and everything else, the last 31 days at sea
have given me a lot of time to reflect. For me, the races to Brest and Rio were
nice - but only nice. I've discovered that I enjoy sailing, but not enough to
spend a year of my life crossing oceans for a month at a time with only a
week's downtime in between. Had I stayed on, I'm pretty sure that 'this is
nice' would have faded to apathy and possibly worse. Having crossed the
Atlantic and the equator, the time has come for me to step off with a bunch of
great memories and lifelong friends.

What now? I'm going to head back to the UK and spend a couple of months with my
family before looking at getting back to work; if you're in London, drop me a
line. We'll be going out to Cape Town to welcome the fleet in, too.

Good luck, Team Mission. See you in Cape Town.
