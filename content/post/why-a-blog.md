In an outbreak of random motivation, I've decided to start keeping a blog. The
main goal is to help me keep track of the various things I'm attempting to
learn about, most of which are technological. If this ends up being useful to
other people, then so much the better.

Things that interest me, and will be covered at some point (I hope):

- IT infrastructure
- Data networks
- UNIX/Linux/BSD
- Scalability
- High availability
- Managing large environments

For another perspective, behold my bookshelf of 'stuff to read', as of a year
ago. (Some of these have been read now - once I source a new camera, I shall
post an updated photo.)
