So, here I am again. The impending [demise] of [Google+] has led me to search
out a new place for posting long-form content and collections of interesting
links.  There are some promising alternatives out there, but I realised that
mostly what I wanted was the ability to log stuff that I've read and done over
the course of a week somewhere that I can come back and reference later.

So, here I am again. I have some ideas for longer form posts, which will
probably be pretty irregular/infrequent. However, the intention is also to post
two "regular" posts a week:

- A collection of interesting links that I've read over the week, hopefully
    with a brief summary of what I've taken away from each of them.
- A list of noteworthy things I've done that week, tech-related or
    otherwise[^1].

Time will tell if I'm able to successfully keep up a reasonable work rate.
Here's a start.

[demise]: https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/
[Google+]: https://plus.google.com/
[^1]: This practice is called "writing snippets" at Google. Longer post coming.
