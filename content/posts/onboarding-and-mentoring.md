Another week, another blog courtesy of the [CodingBlocks] [Slack].

[Steven Leadbeater] asked this set of questions:

> Has anyone ever taken a step back from code to run a team of juniors? Is it
> possible to maintain your output by proxy in the early days of full time
> junior coaching? Can anyone who's done this offer any advice, pitfalls to
> look out for or upsides I might not be thinking of?

Unsurprisingly I have some opinions. Here they are, distilled a bit, and
combined with some good advice from Niklas Asp.

# On productivity

> Is it possible to maintain your output by proxy ...

tl;dr - "no".

And that's fine. Time spent on onboarding/coaching/mentoring is an investment.
You're investing time now for significantly increased productivity deferred by
some number of weeks or months.

One model I learned - I think from another colleague at Google? it's been a
while - is to consider your own output as a simple product of two things:

```
output = productivity * hours worked
```

Simple enough.

## Individual productivity

When you just think about your own personal output, then you can
get more efficient, or you can spend more time working.

Many people early in their career work a lot of hours - that may be because
they can, and they enjoy the work. It may also be because they feel they have
to (this is a cultural problem, but addressing that is a whole set of posts by
itself). In any case, there is still an upper limit to the number of hours one
person can work (let's call it 1.5x more hours than a "normal" work week).
That's before accounting for lifestyle changes which will reduce your
willingness/ability to work long hours.

There are things you can do to improve your own productivity - getting more
familiar with tools, languages, libraries. Getting more practice at design and
implementation. And so on.

But eventually, you'll reach a limit of improved productivity there, as well.
Let's call it 1.5x again, just for the sake of modelling.

This means that by improving yourself and committing to work a frankly
unreasonable 60-70 hours a week, you may get to 2.25x as much output compared
to "junior dev you" working 40 hours a week.

But note that neither of these is sustainable. You probably won't have time to
maintain that level of work and study for your entire career.

## Onboarding and return on investment

In contrast, consider what happens when you onboard a junior and mentor them.

Let's make up some simple assumptions:

- Onboarding a junior will take 50% of your working time for the first 1 month,
    after which time they'll be 50% as productive as you are normally.
- For the next 2 months, mentoring will take 25% of your time, after which
    they'll be 75% as effective as you are.
- For the next 3 months, you'll spend 10% of your time mentoring, after which
    your junior will be 90% as effective as you are normally.

TODO(msuriar): make a graph.

You take a 50% hit in productivity in your first month, after which you have
gained 75% back (50% from your junior, 25% from reduced mentoring time), so
your total output (assuming everyone is working normal hours) is 1.25x your
base output working alone.

After another two months, you are at 1.65x your base output.

At the end of a six month onboarding period, you're at 1.9x your base output,
and no-one has had to work themselves into the ground.

## Sustainability

Assuming you have an environment that lends itself to new people learning and
becoming productive, and your staff turnover isn't too high relative to
onboarding time: in the medium term, onboarding and mentoring junior engineers
is the **single most impactful thing** you can do to improve the output of your
team.
