As mentioned [previously]({{< ref "back-again" >}}), my good intentions to blog
as I learned interesting stuff didn't survive contact with my new employer.

Now that I'm unemployed, I'm going to be writing more frequently here; the main
intention is for this to be a memory aid, but if other people find this stuff
interesting, so be it.

First up: in preparation for my Google interviews, I put together some revision
notes on some fundamentals of networking, which may be of more general use. You
can find them on my Github page: https://github.com/msuriar/network-notes
